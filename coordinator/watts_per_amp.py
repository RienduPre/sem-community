"""(#846) Measured watts-per-amp — SEM checks the result of its own command.

Guido, 26.08, watching PROD: *"the A to the charger is a choice of SEM,
therefore the math is not correcting itself. The idea is from EVCC: fire,
check, adjust."* SEM commanded 16 A, believed it had bought 11.04 kW
(16 × 3 × 230), and the car drew 10.02 kW — a 9 % error on SEM's own
decision, re-issued every cycle and never questioned.

The FIRST build kept one number per (charger, phase count). PROD's own
recorder disproved it the same evening — the car's draw is a function of
the SETPOINT, not a constant:

    8 A → 3.32 kW (415 W/A)  ·  10 A → 5.13 (513)  ·  12 A → 7.13 (594)
    14 A → 8.57 (612)        ·  16 A → 10.02 (626)

Learned at 8 A, a flat model predicts 6.6 kW for 16 A; the car takes 10.0.
That is a 3.4 kW error in the one direction that breaches a budget. So the
commanded amps are part of the key, and each bucket is its own fact.

Design:

* keyed by **(charger, phase count, commanded amps)** — the belief anchors
  the phase count; the learner never argues with it;
* **a median over a short window** per bucket — robust to one blip, and an
  old sample never outvotes today's;
* between two measured setpoints the draw is **bridged linearly in watts**
  — a bridge, not a fact: it lets SEM step onto a setpoint it has not
  measured yet, and the measurement replaces it the first time it stands
  there. Outside the measured range: nameplate;
* **refuses** what it cannot honestly explain — a sample outside a wide
  band around nameplate is a phase-belief question or a taper, and the
  honest answer is nameplate plus a diagnostic naming the reason;
* **never widens a limit** — a measurement may lower what SEM believes it
  bought (freeing headroom), never justify exceeding a configured cap;
  ``amps_for_watts`` walks the ladder DOWN and returns the largest setpoint
  that fits;
* **survives a restart** — ``as_state``/``restore`` (learned state that
  gates behaviour is not allowed to die at boot, the #638 night-2 rule);
* **says what its refusals mean** (#967) — the band is the only place in SEM
  that can see a wrong ``ev_phases``, because a draw on the wrong number of
  phases is exactly what it rejects. Refusing was all it did: the count went
  into a dict no Repair, no card and not even the diagnostics download ever
  read, while every amp SEM commanded went on being converted through a
  nameplate the meter had already refuted. ``phase_verdict`` turns those
  refusals into an answer — and only when they can honestly carry one.

        The physics is asymmetric, and the answer has to be too.

        **More phases than believed is determinate.** One phase carries at
        most ``amps × voltage`` watts, so a draw above that REFUTES the belief
        outright, at any single setpoint — the #804 estimator's own floor
        (``ceil(implied × 0.95)``), reused here. This is the direction that
        matters: believing 1 where 3 are wired makes SEM command three times
        the watts it thinks it bought, through a peak limit.

        **Fewer phases than believed is under-determined.** A car taking a
        third of the offer and a car on one of three phases look identical at
        one setpoint (PROD: a Zoe at a 32 A offer read "1 phase" at 10.15 kW,
        which is impossible at 7.36 kW per phase). What separates them is the
        LADDER: a fixed power cap gives ``W/A ∝ 1/amps``, a phase count gives
        the same W/A at every setpoint. So this direction needs two setpoints
        at least ``_SPREAD_MIN`` apart whose implied counts agree — and where
        SEM never moved the setpoint, it says nothing, which is the honest
        answer rather than a guess that costs the owner 7 kW.

        Two further conditions, both about not crying wolf:
        ``PHASE_VERDICT_REFUSALS`` steady non-tapering cycles behind it, and
        **no bucket under this belief having ever earned trust** — a belief
        that explains real draw is not on trial.

        Returns ``{"believed", "measured", "samples", "watts_per_amp",
        "setpoints"}``; ``samples`` counts only evidence still held, so the
