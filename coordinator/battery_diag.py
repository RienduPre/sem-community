"""#983 — the battery half of the #548 actuation truth.

The EV side has carried an actuation block since #548: for each charger, what
SEM commanded, what the hardware reads back, and what the reconciler last did.
The battery side had nothing, so every battery-control report cost a round
trip for facts SEM was already holding.

@RienduPre's #983 (surplus exporting while the battery looked unfilled) and
#978 (a power-strategy flip cached as done) both turn on two of those facts —
what the strategy select READS versus what SEM believes it set, and whether
the setpoint write was refused — and neither was in his download.

A module of its own, rather than a closure inside the service, so the shape
can be tested against a fabricated adapter: the cases worth pinning are the
ones nobody can reproduce on demand (a select stuck on ``nom``, an entity that
has vanished, an adapter that raises).
