"""The one place SEM reads Home Assistant's recorder.

Why one place (#967). A recorder read that is awaited inside
``async_setup_entry`` is charged to Home Assistant's own start-up budget.
When that budget runs out HA cancels the setup task and the integration
does not load **at all** — the user sees one line, *"Setup of config entry
'Solar Energy Management' ... cancelled"*, and nothing else works. The
cancel arrives as ``CancelledError``, which is not an ``Exception``, so
none of the "this must never cost us the setup" handlers on the way up
catch it. @alexmc1510 hit exactly that after adding his charger to the
Energy Dashboard: one more power sensor, one more history query, over the
line.

So every recorder read goes through here, and every read is:

* **started after Home Assistant has** — :func:`run_after_start` is how a
  caller asks for recorder work. Nothing setup awaits can reach it, so the
  read is never charged to the start-up budget.
* **cheap** — the attributes stay in the database (loading them is most of
  the cost of a long window), and the window is never longer than the
  recorder actually keeps.
* **honest about failure** — ``None`` means the recorder could not answer,
  an empty list means it answered and there was nothing there.
