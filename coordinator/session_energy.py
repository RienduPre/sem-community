"""(#1024) How much energy a charging session delivered, and where it came from.

The TOTAL is the charger's own meter whenever one is known; SEM's power
flows only say how that total SPLITS into solar, grid and battery.

PROD, 10 days to 02.10.2026: summing the flow allocations (solar_to_ev +
grid_to_ev + battery_to_ev) recorded 10–31 % less than KEBA's own session
meter — 25.5 kWh where the meter, and its lifetime counter, said 32.0. The
flows do not cover the whole draw: dark or degraded cycles, clamps and the
allocation order all leave watts unassigned. So the flows were the wrong
place to take a total from.

Order of trust, per session:
  1. ``charger_meter``  — the charger's session counter, once it has shown
     it belongs to THIS session (it rose, or it started near zero);
  2. ``lifetime_delta`` — the rise of the charger's lifetime counter;
  3. ``sem_estimate``   — THIS charger's own measured power, integrated.
     Never the flow sum.

A meter that reads unavailable keeps its last good value. A counter that
drops mid-session (a reset) starts a new segment; what the old segment had
counted is kept.

Pure: no Home Assistant. ``meter`` is a plain dict the caller persists with
the session, so a restart mid-charge loses nothing.
