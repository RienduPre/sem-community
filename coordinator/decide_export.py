"""Pure ``decide_export(fleet) → ExportDecision`` (#955).

The house's meter limit, decided the way SEM's other two control axes are
decided: a pure function of the cycle's inputs. :class:`ExportGuard` (the
tracker) owns hysteresis and "last, not first" — it has already answered
*whether* a write is due this cycle and left its command on the fleet. This
turns that into the intent the seam will write, and nothing else. No hass, no
adapter, no clock.

It exists because the first build of #955 decided IN the coordinator and
dispatched from there: two producers of ``BatteryDecision``, two
``actuate_battery`` call sites, and an observer surface where the two
clobbered each other under one key (found live on .175).

It takes the **fleet**, not a ``BatteryView``. Net house export is owned by no
per-device decider, and reaching for the battery loop's last-assigned view
would make this depend on a loop that only ever runs because a synthetic
``"primary"`` runtime is appended when a house has no configured batteries.
