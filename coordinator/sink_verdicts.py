"""arc #921 — a sink has a STATE, not a price.

SEM's balance layer reasons about energy. Price already decides WHEN in SEM
(cheap hours, negative-import force charge, the arbitrage floor) through the
LEVEL the tariff provider classifies; it must not start deciding HOW MUCH.
So the arc's one model is a per-cycle verdict per destination a kWh can take:

    OPEN   — energy may go there (the sink's own gates still apply)
    HELD   — it may, but not now: keep the energy where it is
    CLOSED — it may not; for the grid this is ENFORCED by the export guard

Computed ONCE per cycle here, threaded into ``FleetCycleState``, and consumed
by the routers (surplus, decide_battery, pacing, the plan). No consumer
re-derives a verdict from a price. Pure: no hass, no clock of its own.

An UNKNOWN price is OPEN, never CLOSED (#925, class 86): "I could not ask" is
not "the meter is hostile", and acting on a missing price would push energy
around for no reason.
