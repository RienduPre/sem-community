"""#955 — the export guard: a limit at the meter, mirroring ``peak_guard``.

The peak guard caps IMPORT per billing slot and every device below it obeys.
This is the same rule mirrored: while the grid-export sink is CLOSED (the
tariff level is NEGATIVE — read, not guessed), cap export at zero. Nothing
here reasons about money: a verdict says the meter is closed and SEM honours
it the way it honours a reserve SOC.

Three rules, each load-bearing:

* **Hysteresis both ways.** Spot prices cross zero repeatedly; a curtailment
  that engages on every crossing is the flapping this project spent months
  removing and a measurable harvest loss. CLOSED must hold ``engage_hold_s``
  before the inverter is touched, OPEN must hold ``release_hold_s`` before it
  is released.
* **Last, not first.** The battery, the car and the loads ran THIS cycle on
  the same verdict. Only export that is still MEASURED at the meter after
  that is clipped — a kWh kept beats a kWh destroyed.
* **Refusal is a state.** A brand with no export control, an adapter that
  raises, a read-back that disagrees: the guard says so, holds, and asks for
  a Repair after three — it never idles silently (class 86: silence reads
  as health).

Pure: the coordinator feeds a monotonic ``now`` and the measured export.
