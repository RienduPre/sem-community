"""Pure-dispatch ``actuate_export(decision, adapter)`` (#955).

The seam for the house's meter limit, mirroring :func:`actuate_battery`: one
intent, one adapter method, no branch on brand. Observer mode cuts the trigger
here and records what SEM WOULD command.

**The key belongs to this seam.** The first build borrowed the battery's
(``battery:<id>``), so the export cut and the battery's own discharge decision
overwrote each other every cycle and the cut was invisible on the rig — found
live on .175 with the compressed sun sim, for a feature whose whole promise is
that it is holding the meter shut (#855: a case is judged on what would hit
the wire, so the wire must be readable).

Returns the refusal text when the write could not happen (no adapter, a brand
with no export control, an adapter that raised), else ``None``. The caller
hands that to the guard; the seam knows nothing about hysteresis. Observer mode
never refuses: nothing was attempted, so nothing was declined.
