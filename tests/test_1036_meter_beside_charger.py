"""#1036 — a meter device next to a charger is not a charger.

Easee's integration ships the Equalizer as its own device beside the
charger. The Equalizer measures the house's grid import and export, and
``_discover_easee`` — like most brand functions — admits a device on a
power reading alone. So SEM offered the Equalizer as a second charger, with
the grid import as its charging power. Its entities come first in the
registry, so it was also the PRIMARY charger: the one
``discover_ev_charger_from_registry`` hands the config flow's first step and
the coordinator's late setup, which then drives it.

The entities below are the real ones from the Easee integration's own
entity descriptions (nordicopen/easee_hass), as the hardware-wave crawler
loaded them. The fix is generic, in the walk every brand shares — so the
last class of pins runs the same meter beside every brand SEM knows.
