"""#947 — a name-matched grid meter must earn its place.

The reporter's `sensor.sem_grid_import_power` was a square wave: ~852 W for
one coordinator cycle, then 0, while every real meter in the house read ~0.
The Energy Dashboard gave SEM grid COUNTERS and no grid power entity, so SEM
matched meters by a SUBSTRING of the entity id — and `power_production`, the
DSMR/P1 feed-in meter's name, matched `sensor.power_production_now`, a SOLAR
FORECAST entity, which SEM then read as the grid export meter.

#911 answered that instance by excluding forecasts. A blacklist over every
sensor in a house cannot be completed: the import patterns reach
`power_consumption`, which this repo's own startup-race fixture uses as a
HEAT PUMP. The root cause is that a name-matched pick was stored
indistinguishably from a configured one and trusted forever.

So the pick is a CANDIDATE until it agrees with the grid energy counters —
the thing SEM already has and did not guess at.
