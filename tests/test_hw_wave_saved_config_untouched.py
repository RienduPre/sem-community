"""#1032 — the role crawler changes DISCOVERY only. An install that already
has a charger keeps its saved mapping, and a charger found only by roles is
never saved or driven without the user accepting it (setup's silent reseed
and the coordinator's late retry keep to the brand paths).

Proven on the real option sets of PROD and HA-TEST (read-only copies) and
the real KEBA's registry from .175."""
