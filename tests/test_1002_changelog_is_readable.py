"""(#1002) A release note nobody reads is not a release note.

RienduPre, 22.09.2026, a contributor who speaks Dutch and works in English
every day:

    "the amount of text and the difficult wording of issues is not what I am
    used to in github issues in general. Often I really have no clue what
    you're trying to tell or ask for. A couple of months ago this was better
    but now it's getting so worse that I don't even read the issues and
    changelog any more."

He stopped reading, so he stopped helping. That is the cost.

There has been a rule since 04.06.2026 — release notes are "one-liner
bullets", "no multi-paragraph prose" — and nothing measured it, so the
median entry grew to about 100 words and the longest reached 228. A rule
with no mechanism is a preference; this file is the mechanism.

It guards ``[Unreleased]`` only. Shipped sections are history and history is
not rewritten — but nothing ships over the cap again.
