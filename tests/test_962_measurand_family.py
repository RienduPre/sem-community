"""#962 — a charger's ADVERTISED capability is never its measurement.

Reporter (@bgthb, 2.0.0, Huawei SCharger 22-KT over lbbrhzn/ocpp): SEM read
the charger as drawing full power at all times, with no car plugged in.
Auto-detection had bound ``sensor.wallbox_power_offered`` as
``ev_charging_power_sensor`` and ``sensor.wallbox_energy_active_export_interval``
as ``ev_total_energy_sensor``.

Root cause: OCPP names its sensors after the PROTOCOL's measurands, so one
charge point publishes a whole family under ``device_class: power``
(``Power.Active.Import``, ``Power.Offered``, ``Power.Active.Export``) and
another under ``device_class: energy``. Every brand matcher binds these read
roles on the device class ALONE and keeps the first/last entity it happens to
see, so registry ORDER picked — and ``Power.Offered`` is the box's nameplate,
reported continuously whether or not a car is connected. SEM then infers a
connection "from physics" (``sensor_reader``: current cannot flow without a
plug), so an idle charger reads as a charging car forever.

Bug class 89 (a read role bound among measurand siblings that share domain +
device_class). The closure is brand-agnostic — ``_reject_capability_sensor``
runs inside ``apply_charger_discovery_guards``, the one choke point all four
discovery paths funnel through — so these pins assert the CLASS:

* the reporter's own family resolves to the measurands SEM asked for;
* the answer does not depend on registry ORDER, for any brand;
* no brand, hinted or hand-written, can bind a capability-named sensor to a
  read role;
* a family with nothing but capabilities DROPS the role (fail-closed: a
  missing power reading is honest, a nameplate read as a measurement is not);
* "rated" inside ``solar_generated_power`` is not the word "rated"
  (class 67 — the rules read segments, not substrings).
