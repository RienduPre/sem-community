"""(#998) The ledger of unproven causal claims only ever shrinks.

Bug class 99 is *a verdict naming a cause its own scope refutes*. #992 swept
it by reading — three passes, nine files, twelve fixes — and then a reviewer
found two more INSIDE those fixes, and a thirteenth turned up minutes after
the merge in a file the sweep never opened. That is not a failure of care.
It is what reading nine files out of twenty-four gets you.

So this is a RATCHET, not a ban. A reason that merely describes the decision
needs nothing. A reason that asserts something about the WORLD is a claim,
and a claim carries ``# CAUSE:`` naming the state in that scope which proves
it. Writing the annotation is the work: it is what surfaces the ones that
cannot be written.

The worked example is the one this mechanism was built beside. The charger
hold said ``inputs degraded (sensor unavailable)``. Try to annotate it and
you cannot: the flag behind it is raised by three different gates, and two
of them are sensors that answered perfectly well with a number SEM chose to
disbelieve. The annotation fails, so the string changes — it names the read
that actually went dark.
