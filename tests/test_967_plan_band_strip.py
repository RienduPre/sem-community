"""#967 — Solar + cheapest hours booked the charge into the peak band.

@alexmc1510 (#966, same install as #939): Victron EVCS, 60 kWh Tesla,
``solar_plus_cheap``, At least 60 % / Up to 80 %, Charge by 06:00, car at
~29 %. Spanish 2.0TD — a FIXED three-period schedule (valle 0.07 from 00:00,
llano 0.11, punta 0.20 at 18–22) served as a dynamic price series, so every
hour through tomorrow is priced. ``target_peak_limit`` 3.5 kW. His 14:06
screenshot: the EV card's strip paints "charging" from **20:36** (the night
window open, sunset + 10) to **~21:40** — inside the punta band the same
strip paints pink — and the bar is far too short for the 19.8 kWh he needs.

This file is the diagnostics his download could not give (the plan shadow
is not exported — that is defect D4, fixed in the same branch). It builds
his night from his numbers and walks it through the SAME pure functions the
coordinator uses, in the same order, so the picture on his screen is
reproduced here rather than reasoned about:

  ledger → pack_night → the stamped dict → plan_gate → ev_overlay
         → plan_night_charge → compose_today_plan → the card's segment rule

Three defects it pins (the fourth is diagnostics):

* **D1** — with no per-charger night plan during the day, the composer's
  fallback re-derived the EV need from ``daily_ev_target`` (his: 4.5 kWh, a
  per-DAY knob) at a hard-coded 4.1 kW. 4.5 / 4.1 = 66 min: 20:36 + 1:06 =
  **21:42**. That is his bar. The one producer of the need is
  ``build_night_target_map`` → ``_calculate_remaining_need`` = 19.8 kWh.
* **D2** — the EV card paints ``night_open`` as *charging* unless a start row
  carries ``plan_ev_charge_tariff``; a joint-plan start never counts, and
  nothing emits ``ev_wait``. Even a plan that books the valle hours paints
  charging from the window open.
* **D3** — anything but ``fits`` leaves the gate UNCOVERED, and the reactive
  night layer it falls back to has had no tariff awareness since #638 C3: it
  starts at ``night_start``. Under 2.0TD that is the most expensive hour of
  the night, with nine hours of cheaper ones still ahead of a 06:00 deadline.
