"""#955 — the export cut stays on SEM's one track, structurally.

Guido, reading the built arc: *"is this implemented where all the decisions
are taking place, or are we on a second track? I remember having 3 layers in
SEM."* He was right: the first build decided IN the coordinator, so there
were two producers of ``BatteryDecision``, two ``actuate_battery`` call
sites, and an observer surface where they clobbered each other under one key
— which is how the cut came out invisible on .175.

**What this file claims, and what it does not.** SEM does NOT have a single
universal rule that every write goes through a decide layer: ``charge_pacing``
and ``load_management`` call services directly today, and a ruflo review
refuted that broader framing when this arc first asserted it. The claim here
is narrower and true: the two axes that share the battery adapters — the
battery itself and the house's meter limit — each have ONE producer of their
decision, ONE seam that writes it, and a decider that touches nothing outside
the decide layer.

Structural, not textual (#925/#924): a grep for ``"actuate_export("`` passes
on a mention in a comment and is blind to the sibling call site that is the
actual defect. These walk the parsed tree.
