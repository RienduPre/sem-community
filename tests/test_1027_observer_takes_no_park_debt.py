"""#1027 — a SEM that only watches neither parks a charger nor hands one back.

Guido's test install ran with the observer switch ON, watching a KEBA that a
second SEM really controls. Removing it sent ``keba.enable`` and put the box's
failsafe back on its charging fallback. No car was plugged in, so nothing
happened that day.

Three steps had to line up, and each of them read one layer's answer as
another's:

1. ``send`` is the single hardware seam (#855) and it WITHHOLDS while SEM
   watches, returning False. ``park_off`` read "the call did not raise" as
   "the box was parked" and wrote the park debt to disk — on every
   disconnect, for a box it had never touched.
2. The next setup adopted that record, so a lifetime that commands nothing
   believed it had parked a wallbox.
3. Removal hands back every box SEM parked. That gate saw the adopted flag
   and said yes — the first real command of the lifetime, on somebody else's
   hardware.

The rule is #936's, written for batteries and extended to the export cut by
#955: watching takes no debt and pays none. The record belongs to the
lifetime that really parked the box, so it is left exactly as it is — and the
first cycle that can command again adopts it (#949's rule for the pacer).
