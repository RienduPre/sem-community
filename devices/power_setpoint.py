"""(#880) A surplus load whose control is a watt setpoint, not a switch.

SEM's surplus allocator has always handed each device the watts it may
have — ``activate(available_watts)`` and ``adjust_power(available_watts)``
are on the base contract and the controller calls both every cycle. Every
implementation but the EV chargers' threw the number away: ``SwitchDevice``
turns the entity fully on and reports its nameplate, so a my-PV AC-THOR or
any other modulating load ran at whatever it felt like, and the allocator's
remaining-surplus arithmetic was wrong on top.

@jonasbkarlsson reproduced it on a plain Home Assistant number helper, so no
integration is implicated: "SEM correctly detects available/distributable PV
surplus, but never writes a value to the configured Number control entity.
The allocated surplus therefore remains at 0 W."

This class is the missing one. It writes the allocation, clamped to the
entity's own min/max and quantised to its step, and reports what it wrote.

Two things it deliberately does NOT do:

* check observer mode — the controller does that before calling
  (``coordinator/surplus_controller.py``);
* set ``_sem_owned`` — ownership is recorded at the one choke point,
  ``_activate_owned``, and guarded by
  ``tests/test_load_ownership_choke_point.py``. Bug class 17 lives here.
