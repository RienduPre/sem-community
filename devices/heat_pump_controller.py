"""Heat pump SG-Ready controller for Solar Energy Management.

Implements SG-Ready (Smart Grid Ready) standard for heat pump control:
- State 1 (00): BLOCKED - utility request to reduce consumption
- State 2 (01): NORMAL - standard operation
- State 3 (10): BOOST - recommended increased consumption (solar surplus)
- State 4 (11): FORCE_ON - forced maximum consumption (high surplus/cheap price)

Control is via two relay entities (Shelly/ESPHome) mapped to SG-Ready pins.
Temperature boost via climate entity for additional thermal storage.
