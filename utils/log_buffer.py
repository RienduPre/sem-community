"""In-memory ring buffer of SEM log records for the diagnose surface.

Supervisor installs route Home Assistant's log to journald — there is no
flat ``home-assistant.log`` to tail, so the diagnose payload's
``recent_logs`` was a "please run `ha core logs`" placeholder on exactly
the installs that report bugs most (the entire #461/#462 triage ran
without log visibility). A ``logging.Handler`` attached to the
integration's root logger captures every SEM record regardless of where
HA routes its output: child loggers (``…solar_energy_management.coordinator
.sensor_reader`` etc.) propagate to the ancestor logger, whose handlers
see the records.

INFO and above only — DEBUG would balloon the dump and the diagnose
surface targets "what was SEM doing around the incident", not tracing.

(#820) A write SEM sends with ``blocking=False`` is refused by the OTHER
integration, and Home Assistant logs that refusal under its own logger —
never SEM's. @ArneGollin1987's charge limit sat at 1560 W for days and the
one line that would have said why was in a log he could not find. So a tap
on the root logger keeps WARNING-and-above records from other loggers that
name an entity SEM writes to, in a small list of their own, tagged FOREIGN.
